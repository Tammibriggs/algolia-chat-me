# History Control

Control whether chat sessions are logged for future reference.

## Disable Session Logging

Use `disableHistory()` to prevent chat logs from being saved.

```js
sdk.disableHistory();
```

- No chat history will be stored for the current session
- Useful for privacy-sensitive conversations

### Example Use Cases
- Hide chat logs for confidential support
- Temporary sessions that shouldn't be tracked

### Edge Cases
- Once disabled, cannot be re-enabled for the same session
- Does not affect previous sessions
